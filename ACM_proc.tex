\section{Introduction}

Much has been done in the literature and in the industry on static prediction of defective files in software development. However most of the work focus on using only source code data or commit data to try to predict defective files. We introduce a novel way of predicting defective files by incorporating build data into the prediction.

Build data can be crucial to the predictiveness of an algorithm, because it encompass a varied range of extra information, such as
